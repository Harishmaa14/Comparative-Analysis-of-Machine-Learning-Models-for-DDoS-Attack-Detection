# Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Models-for-DDoS-Attack-Detection
This project presents a comparative study of various machine learning algorithms for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using a labeled network traffic dataset (ddos.csv). The dataset’s features are standardized before being split into training and testing sets. Several classifiers—including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Linear Regression (adapted for classification), and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network—are trained and evaluated on the dataset. The performance of each model is assessed using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This approach allows for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different models in identifying malicious network traffic patterns characteristic of DDoS attacks. The results provide valuable insights into selecting effective machine learning techniques for enhancing cybersecurity defenses against network-based threats.
